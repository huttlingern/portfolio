      <h1>About Me</h1>

          <p>Hello friends, my name is Nick. I am just starting out on my path towards becoming a Software Devoloper. I was born and raised in Southern California but moved to Arizona with my mother and have called this state home for about 8 years now. I enjoy anything outdoors when the weather is right.</p>
      <h1>Background</h1>
          <p>I am a high school graduate with some college experience. In the past, I have played the role of a Collections Agent, Security Guard, Sandwich Architect at Subway and a Christmas Tree Lot Attendant. As far as developing goes I have played with HTML and CSS as a hobby but am now ready to jump into developing as a career.</p>
      <h1>Why Programming?</h1>
          <p>I assume this question will become more frequent throughout my stay at Coder Camps but in short, I chose this path because programming is just a lot of fun!</p>
